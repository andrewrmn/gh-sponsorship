  testimonial1: Most developer events are very transactional, but GitHub events aren’t at all. The aesthetic is intentional, the conversations are meaningful, and all of our customers are happy to be there.

  testimonial2: GitHub events are more like magical productions than conferences – like Disneyland except with an octocat instead of Mickey. The GitHub Team considers every detail and makes it easy for sponsors to plug into it all. We couldn’t have been happier with the experience.
