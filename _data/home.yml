  testimonial1: We like getting leads, but we care a lot more about having quality conversations. The developers we meet as sponsors are genuinely interested in a two-way conversation about our products, so we end up getting so much more out of GitHub events than your typical conferences.

  testimonial2: GitHub worked with us to build the perfect experience to showcase IBM and our products at Universe. We had all the services we needed to attract hundreds of people to our lounge, and every person who stopped by was the type of software professional we wanted to meet. You don’t get that at any other event.
