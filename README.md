## Edit an event

### For each event
1. Open the event's .yml file in [this directory](https://github.com/github/sponsorship-prospectus/tree/master/_data).
2. This file will contain everything for the event except for the url and the order of the event.
3. To add images, navigate to [this directory](https://github.com/github/sponsorship-prospectus/tree/master/assets/images/events) then place the images in their respective event folder.
4. When adding photos in the .yml file, the image path should NOT include `assets/images/`. For example, if adding an image to Universe, the path would be `events/universe/image-file-name.png`.
5. To change the url or event order, open the city's file in the [_events directory](https://github.com/github/sponsorship-prospectus/tree/master/_events). The date field here is strictly for ordering purposes. The older the date, the earlier the event will display on the events landing page. (2018-1-1 will display before 2018-1-5).
6. If you would like someone to review your changes, commit them as a pull request and cc @andrewrmn or @sophshep. We will then approve and merge them.
